It is an iterative method: a number of steps are repeated cyclically, at each iteration one gets a better approximation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the iteration is stopped when the approximation is good enough. It works as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Implement the power method within the function ```power_method```, with the following specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *vector* $v$ is not necessarily a one-dimensional array, we want the flexibility to use more abstract vector spaces whose elements are generic $d$-dimensional arrays. In practice, the *vectors* $v$ must be implemented as ```numpy.ndarrays```. In this setup, the squared norm $\\|v\\|^2$ of the *vector* $v$ is given by the sum of the squared absolute value of all elements of $v$. Moreover, the *matrix* $A$ really needs to be thought as a linear function acting on the elements of the abstract vector space.\n",
